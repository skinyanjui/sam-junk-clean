# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on modernizing the Pricing and Locations pages to create a more contemporary, engaging user experience. The current pages have functional components but lack modern design elements, interactive features, and compelling copy that would enhance user engagement and conversion rates. The redesign will focus on visual appeal, user interaction patterns, and persuasive content while maintaining the core functionality of both pages.
