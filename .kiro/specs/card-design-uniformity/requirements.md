# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a unified and consistent card design system across all sections of the application. After comprehensive analysis, the application contains numerous card implementations with varying styles, layouts, and visual treatments across:

- **Home Section**: ServiceCard, PricingOverview cards, TestimonialsSection cards, FeaturedProjects cards, BenefitCard, StatsSection cards
- **Blog Section**: BlogCard (standard and featured variants), BlogNewsletter cards
- **Careers Section**: JobCard with complex tabbed content
- **Locations Section**: ServiceAreaCard with tabbed interfaces
- **Services Section**: Service listing cards
- **Pricing Section**: PricingDisplay cards, TruckVisualizer cards, AdditionalPricing cards
- **Contact Section**: ContactForm glass-card styling
- **FAQ Section**: FaqCategory cards with collapsible content
- **Quote Section**: QuickQuoteForm, QuoteForm, ProcessSteps cards, PricingReference cards
- **Conversion Components**: PersonalizedExitIntent cards, SocialProofNotifications cards

The goal is to establish a cohesive design language that maintains visual hierarchy while ensuring all cards follow consistent patterns for spacing, typography, shadows, borders, and interactive states.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing the website, I want all cards to have a consistent visual appearance, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any section with cards THEN all cards SHALL follow the same base design system
2. WHEN cards are displayed in different sections THEN they SHALL maintain consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
3. WHEN cards contain different content types THEN they SHALL adapt the base design appropriately while maintaining consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user interacting with cards, I want consistent hover and focus states, so that the interface behavior is predictable and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over any card THEN it SHALL display the same hover animation and visual feedback
2. WHEN a user focuses on a card using keyboard navigation THEN it SHALL show consistent focus indicators
3. WHEN cards are interactive THEN they SHALL provide the same visual cues for clickable elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing cards on different devices, I want them to maintain their design consistency across all screen sizes, so that the experience is uniform regardless of device.
