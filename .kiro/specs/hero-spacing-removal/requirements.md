# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on removing the top and bottom padding/spacing from all hero sections across the website. The current hero sections have excessive padding that takes up valuable screen real estate and pushes important content below the fold. By removing this unnecessary spacing, we'll create a more streamlined user experience, improve content visibility, and ensure that key information is immediately accessible to users without requiring excessive scrolling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want hero sections to be more compact with less vertical padding, so that I can see more content without scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user visits any page with a hero section THEN the system SHALL display the hero with reduced or eliminated top padding
2. WHEN a user visits any page with a hero section THEN the system SHALL display the hero with reduced or eliminated bottom padding
3. WHEN a user views the hero section THEN the content SHALL maintain proper alignment and visual hierarchy despite reduced spacing
4. WHEN a user views the hero section on mobile devices THEN the reduced spacing SHALL be proportionally adjusted for smaller screens

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want consistent hero spacing across all pages, so that the website maintains a uniform look and feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN comparing hero sections across different pages THEN they SHALL have consistent top padding/spacing
2. WHEN comparing hero sections across different pages THEN they SHALL have consistent bottom padding/spacing
3. WHEN new pages are created THEN the system SHALL apply the same hero spacing standards automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website developer, I want a centralized approach to hero spacing, so that future spacing adjustments can be made efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN hero spacing needs to be modified THEN the system SHALL require changes in as few places as possible
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN hero spacing SHALL be controlled through shared components or styling variables
3. WHEN implementing the spacing changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing responsive behavior of hero sections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the redesigned hero sections to maintain proper visual separation, so that I can easily distinguish between different page sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user with visual impairments views the hero section THEN there SHALL still be sufficient visual separation from adjacent content
2. WHEN a screen reader user navigates the page THEN the semantic structure SHALL remain clear despite reduced spacing
3. WHEN a user with cognitive disabilities views the page THEN the visual hierarchy SHALL remain clear despite reduced spacing
